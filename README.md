# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the price of a car based on its features using a machine learning regression model built in Python. It demonstrates a typical data science pipeline: from raw data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset is a CSV file containing various attributes of cars. You can use a dataset like:

| Make  | Model | Year | Transmission | Mileage | Fuel_Type | Engine_Size | Price |
|-------|-------|------|--------------|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| BMW   | 3 Series | 2015 | Manual     | 50000   | Petrol    | 2.0L         | 12000 |
| Audi  | A4       | 2017 | Automatic  | 30000   | Diesel    | 2.0L         | 15000 |
